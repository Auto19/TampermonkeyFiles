# TamperMonkeyFiles

This is a github repository deticated to code I write for TamperMonkey.

TamperMonkey can be installed from the chrome store, I use the beta version since it has a nicer feel.

Once you have it installed copy and paste the code into a new script and go to the website listed under @match.

There you go, the code should run.  All code should be commented unless it isn't in which case \\_( ^ - ^ )_/ I probably don't understand it either.
